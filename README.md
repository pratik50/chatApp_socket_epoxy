# Chat App with Epoxy Integration

This repository contains the same **Chat App** as the previous one, with the addition of **Epoxy** for efficient and flexible UI rendering.

### Link to the previous repository:

- [Previous Chat App Repo](https://github.com/pratik50/ChatApp_Socket.io)

### Note:
- The previous adapter files are still present but are **commented out** in the code for reference. The new Epoxy-based approach is now the main method of rendering chat messages.
